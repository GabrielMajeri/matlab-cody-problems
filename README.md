# Solutions for MATLAB Cody problems

This repository contains my solutions to various MATLAB learning problems/exercises from the [MATLAB Cody](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody?q=&page=1) platform. They were ran and tested either in the online code runner or using [Octave](https://octave.org/).

I recommend everyone to solve these problems themselves to hone their scientific computing skills, but it's helpful to have some solutions to look at if no other option is available.
